Enemy
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint
Natural
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural
Rewrite The Stars
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pullin' you miles away and out of a reach from me
But you're hearin' my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothin' could keep us apart
You'll be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
And maybe the world could be ours, tonight
Ah-oh (no, no, no, no)
Ah-oh (mm)
You think it's easy
You think I don't wanna run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (but there are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everythin' keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find (the one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me (yeah)
When everyone tells us what we can be
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours, tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible (it's not impossible)
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible
And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothin' could keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changin' the world to be ours
Ay, ah-oh (no, no, no, no)
Ah-oh (mm)
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied
Arcade
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I spent all of the love I've saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up, didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this roller-coaster
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Hall of Fame
Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
You can beat the world, you can win the war
You can talk to God, go banging on his door
You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock
You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
Some will call that practice, some will call that luck
But either way you're going to the history books
Standing in the Hall of Fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame
You can go the distance, you can run a mile
You can walk straight through hell with a smile
You can be a hero, you can get the gold
Breaking all the records they thought would never be broke
Yeah, do it for your people, do it for your pride
Are you ever gonna know if you never even try?
Do it for your country, do it for your name
'Cause there's gonna be a day when you're
Standing in the Hall of Fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame
You'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame
Be students, be teachers
Be politicians, be preachers, yeah (yeah)
Be believers, be leaders
Be astronauts, be champions
Be truth seekers
Be students, be teachers
Be politicians, be preachers, yeah (yeah)
Be believers, be leaders
Be astronauts, be champions
Standing in the Hall of Fame

And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame
Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
You can beat the world, you can win the war
You can talk to God, go bangin' on his door
You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock
You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
Some will call it practice, some will call that luck
But either way you're going to the history books
Standing in the Hall of Fame
Stressed Out
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
Umbrella
Uh huh, uh huh (yeah, Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down like Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me (you know me)
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back
With Little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me (there's no distance in between our love)
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come into me

Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come into me
Come into me

It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain, come into me

Payphone
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (oh)
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now, when you see me, I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me had chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show, you can tell that I'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say, it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now, it's me who they want, so you can go
And take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah, yeah)
If "Happy Ever After" did exist (oh, yeah)
I would still be holding you like this
All these fairy tales are full of shit
Yeah, one more fucking love song, I'll be sick (yeah)
Now, I'm at a payphone
Friends
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Here we go again
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye

No, no, yeah, uh, ah

We're just friends
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going nowhere without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times
Haven't I made it obvious? (Have I not made it obvious?)
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)
Want me to spell it out for you? (Yo)
F-R-I-EN-D-S (I said F-R-I-E-N-D-S)

Mmm, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah, ah-oh, ah
Perfect
I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
Alone
Lost in your mind, I wanna know
Am I losin' my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever, at least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind, l'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away
If this night is not forever, at least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)
Waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
Oh, I'm in the jungle now
You've been seeking, I've been hiding out
Use your love, it scares me so deep down
You may find me, 'cause my heart beats loud, so loud
It beats fast, in the places where you touched me last
I can feel the burn my skin, it has
But the return of your beloved hands, hands
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
'Cause boy, I'm in your waterfall
(Waterfall)
Oh, I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
Baby, you're my oxygen
When I cannot find my way on Earth
You know I can be when I hold on
Even when the rapid's strong
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
'Cause babe, I'm in your waterfall
(Waterfall)
But I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Waterfall
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Waterfall
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
'Cause boy, I'm in your waterfall
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh, I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm in your waterfall
(I'm in your waterfall)
I'm in your waterfall
(I'm in your waterfall)
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm Still Standing
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know, while I'm still standing, you just fade away
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life, without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Viva la vida
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
The Nights
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
"When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
Wake Me Up
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know
Impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did, I did
You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did, I did
And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts, I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear, I know, I know
And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead, tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Oh, impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
Radioactive
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, ooh
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flag and dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, ooh
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, ooh
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
All systems go
The Sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Demons
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Believer
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Eh, eheu, eheu
Eh, eheu, eheu
Eh, eheu, eheu

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Eheu, eheu

Oh, where do we begin?

Oh, oh, where do we begin?

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?

Waiting For Love
Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars, it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars, it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
Numb
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me, with someone disappointed in you
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Try
Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin'?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better
To never ask why
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right?
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Ever worry that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Titanium
You shout it loud
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof vest
You shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Miss You Everyday
Okay, okay
I won't ask you to stay

Just know that I
Will miss you every day

They claim your heart, and then they go
A fool to try, and take control
Oh, I'll be fine, that's what I say
But deep inside, will miss you every day
Okay, okay
I won't ask you to stay
My love, this time
Won't let it ricochet
The seasons' change
There's nothing left to say
Just know that I
Will miss you every day
I'll miss you every day, I'll miss you
I'll miss you every day
I'll miss you every day, I'll miss you
I'll miss you every day

Reality
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
I can fly high, I can go low.
Today I got a million,
Tomorrow, I don't know.
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
I can fly high, I can go low.
Today I got a million, Tomorrow, I don't know.
Stop claiming what you own and think about the show.
We're all playing the same game, waiting on our loan.
We're unknown and known, special and a clone.
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow.
Make me feel the warmth
make me feel the cold
It's written in our story
it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight,
don't we have it all?
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
I can fly high, I can go low.
Today I got a million,
Tomorrow, I don't know.
Make me feel the warmth,
make me feel the cold.
It's written in our story,
it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall.
Dancin' in the moonlight
don't we have it all?
Remember Our Summer
Lately I wanna stay awake
I don't want the days to end
I know you'll fly away
Need to hold you
I feel the time run through my hands
Try to grab it but it fades
Say goodbye in all the possible ways
I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?
I'll anesthetize the pain
Please remember our summer
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Come the sun
Come the rain
And the leaves falling
I will wait even if the seasons change
Anxiety runs through my veins
I'll escape from all these chains
Say come back in all the possible ways
I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?
I'll anesthetize the pain
Please remember our summer
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Dusk Till Dawn
Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins, just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(Baby, I'm right here)
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the rapids
To find a wave that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins, just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(Baby, I'm right here)
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
Girl, give love to your body
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
